# Simulation of Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Tree-Based Models

Ravi Brenner

This repo contains the work I did for my final project in P9120: Topics in Statistical Learning and Data Mining.

The writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/p9120_final_project_writeup.pdf) and the code I used can be found [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/ensemble_trees.Rmd) in an Rmarkdown format and [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/ensemble_trees.md) in a github-readable format.

I had an idea to do a different project entirely, using RNNs and an embedding layer to predict stock prices, and then to look at that learned embedding layer to identify similarities in the stock price behavior, and compare that to a simple correlation matrix approach. Unfortunately that was too difficult for me to learn in the timeline needed for this class. I still think it would make for an interesting project and hope to take it on at a later date. Some of the files and code for that are in this repo too.
