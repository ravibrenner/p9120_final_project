# Simulation of Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Tree-Based Models

Ravi Brenner

This repo contains the work I did for my final project in P9120: Topics in Statistical Learning and Data Mining.

The writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/p9120_final_project_writeup.pdf) and the code I used can be found [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/ensemble_trees.Rmd) in an Rmarkdown format and [here](https://github.com/ravibrenner/p9120_final_project/blob/master/ensemble_trees.md) in a github-readable format.
